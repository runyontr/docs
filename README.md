## LLM Agents Design

LLM (Low-level Machine Learning) Agents are a component of our software project. They are designed to handle low-level machine learning tasks and provide a framework for integrating machine learning algorithms into our system. The design of LLM Agents provides the following key features:

- Abstract Interface: LLM Agents provide an abstract interface that allows developers to easily integrate different machine learning algorithms into the system.
- Modular Structure: LLM Agents are designed in a modular structure, allowing for easy customization and extension depending on project requirements.
- Scalability: The design of LLM Agents provides scalability for handling large datasets and complex machine learning tasks efficiently.
- Flexibility: LLM Agents are designed to be flexible, allowing for easy experimentation and iteration with different algorithms and approaches.
- Performance Optimization: The design of LLM Agents incorporates performance optimization techniques to ensure efficient execution of machine learning tasks.

In summary, LLM Agents are designed to provide a flexible and scalable framework for integrating machine learning algorithms into our software project.
