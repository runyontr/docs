## LLM Agents Design

LLM Agents are designed to be highly modular and extensible. They follow the microservices architecture pattern, where each agent is responsible for a specific functionality or domain.

The design of LLM Agents promotes loose coupling and separation of concerns. Each agent operates independently and communicates with other agents through well-defined APIs. This allows for flexibility and scalability, as new agents can be easily added or existing agents can be modified without impacting the overall system.

To ensure robustness, LLM Agents are built with fault tolerance in mind. They use resilient communication protocols and implement mechanisms for handling failures gracefully. This guarantees that the system remains functional even in the face of unexpected errors or disruptions.

Overall, LLM Agents are designed to provide a flexible and resilient solution for managing and controlling various aspects of the software project. Their modular architecture and fault-tolerant design make them highly suitable for complex and large-scale projects.
